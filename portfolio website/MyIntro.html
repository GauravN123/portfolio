      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, My name is Gaurav Nahata. ​I am doing my Bachelors in Technology
        with Computer Science stream from KIIT University with 8.65 CGPA. Also,
        I did my 12th & 10th from CBSE Board in the year 2021 and 2019
        respectively. Though I am currently staying in Bhubaneswar – I was born
        and brought up in Guwahati, Assam, and did my schooling from there.
        Considering my family background details – I have a joint family . As
        you’d have known – I am here for the role of Frontend Developer. Coming
        to my skills I know HTML , CSS , JavaScript , C , C++ , Java . To be
        honest, my short-term goal is to get a job in a reputed company like
        Google , Microsoft , Goldman Sachs etc where I can use my skills and
        knowledge to deliver value-added result and in long term, the goal would
        be to achieve a good position in the particular company to scale up
        organization’s production & growth rate and at the same time for the
        betterment of my personal career growth as well. Other than that, if I
        talk about my strengths – I can say that I’m a quick learner, team
        player, adaptable and creative person – and I do guess that these
        strengths of mine are perfectly suitable for this job role. In my free
        time, I enjoy spending time with my family, reading, playing outdoor
        sports like Cricket , Table Tennis , badminton . That’s all about me.
        And yes, thanks for the opportunity given to introduce myself!”
